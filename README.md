# LoL-AI-Bots
Utilizing Machine Learning to create a 5 man team of bots to compete with real world players.
  
## Purpose
__ >>> Inspire learning new algorithms for Machine Learning using games.<br/>
__ >>> Help those getting started using GitHub, Python or is new to Machine Learning to be able to be involved in a project that is hands-on and fun to play with.<br/>
__ >>> Expand algorithms used in bots for video games.<br/>
__ >>> Research how to create AI Bots that can interact together as a team.<br/>
  
## Why League of Legends
  League of Legends is a free-to-play Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) that limits enough gameplay actions to reduce complexity of system design. In other words, because League of Legends contains limited methods of playing (i.e. attacking turrets, enemy minions, enemy champions, movement, 5 skills, and 7 items), this allows the possibility of coordinating a TEAM of AI bots to play together against an opponent.
